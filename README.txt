Instructions to Run our code: (local.py) [We used Python 3.7.6 in a conda environment]

1. Install Python library 'networkx' as follows:

pip install networkx

We also use the following Python libraries, so if they are not installed (will be notified when trying to execute), use pip to install them:
collections, dataclasses, typing, queue, copy, sys

2. Execute the code (assuming input file exists in same directory as main.py) in the following way:

python main.py <input_file_name> <output_file_name>

Example: python local.py input.txt output.txt


Changes made:

Paradigm shift from branch and bound to local search (basic version without heuristics), which tries to improve the intial solution computed making use of minimum degree sum shortest path heuristic.
